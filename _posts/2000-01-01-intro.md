This package provides an interface to the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)
API. FRED covers 240,000 US and international macroeconomic time series from 77
sources (including the World Bank, OECD, and BIS).

FredR has been designed in a way that gives a user a complete interface to all
available functionalities of the API. Currently, the package is still poorly
documented (improving on this will be the next step). However, the naming
conventions used in the package map one-to-one to the official API calls, so one
can for now use the official API documentation (available here) to see the
meaning of particular functions and parameters.
